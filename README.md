Election_Analysis
=================

In this project, our final Python script was able to deliver the following
information when the script is run: 

-   Total number of votes cast

-   A complete list of candidates who received votes

-   Total number of votes each candidate received

-   Percentage of votes each candidate won

-   The winner of the election based on popular vote
